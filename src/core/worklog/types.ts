/**
 * Worklog — the engine-first "desync-killer" activity log.
 *
 * A durable, append-only stream of *significant* activity, scoped per **company**
 * (one log per company; boundary = company members). The point is an engine that
 * runs itself: CC hooks capture activity AND inject recent state back before an
 * agent acts — so nobody has to remember to run a command, yet desync stops.
 *
 * Kinds:
 *   - tool          significant tool call (git/gh Bash, Edit/Write)
 *   - conversation  a decision/instruction (UserPromptSubmit, "Tony→oracle: X")
 *   - pr-opened/merged/closed   PR lifecycle (gh ground truth)
 *   - claim / claim-release     soft-lock announce + release (collision guard)
 *   - interrupt     reserved — no clean CC hook (deferred)
 *
 * See thread `eq3-lead-dispatch-lock`.
