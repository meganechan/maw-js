/**
 * duplicate-scope-warn — kobo-608: warn (never block) at card-creation time when
 * a new card's scope looks like it overlaps an OPEN card that already exists.
 *
 * Board Truth's own diagnosis (the card's evidence section): everyone who opened
 * a duplicate this session already knew the rule "check before you open" — the
 * rule failed because checking means reading every open title by eye, and the
 * fastest known real pair (kobo-588/kobo-589) landed within minutes of each
 * other. "Be more careful" cannot fix a check that's too slow for a human to
 * run in time; this is a machine check instead.
 *
 * NO MEASURED NUMBERS LIVE IN THIS COMMENT, ON PURPOSE — read this section
 * before adding one back. Every number this feature has ever published in
 * prose (a docstring, a card comment) has independently failed
 * re-verification once: measured against the wrong text window, measured on
 * a commit that had already moved under it, or simply couldn't be reproduced
 * at all — by three different people, on three separate rounds, none of them
 * careless. That's not one person's bad luck; it's a property of writing a
 * number derived from a growing, mutable board into a comment that reads as
 * permanent fact and gets merged. Board Truth already names the fix for the
 * identical shape at the list level ("lists expire, rules don't" — a frozen
 * name-list is the wrong artifact; a frozen number computed FROM that same
 * kind of list has the identical shelf life). What belongs here instead:
 * the RULE (what counts as a match, what doesn't) and the METHOD (how to
 * measure it). What a number was on a given date belongs on the kobo-608
 * card, tagged with the measurement date and the snapshot path it was taken
 * from — and even there, treat it as a historical record of that date, never
 * as a claim about the board today.
 *
 * MEASURE IT YOURSELF — `bun scripts/measure-duplicate-scope.ts --tasks-dir
 * <dir>` — never trust a number typed into prose, including this one. The
 * script re-implements nothing: it calls the real exported `findSimilarOpenCards`
 * so it can't silently drift from what actually ships. Point it at a frozen
 * snapshot copy for a reproducible before/after comparison (never a live,
 * still-growing directory — two sequential live reads aren't comparable, the
 * exact mistake this card's own design process caught itself making once)
 * or at a live company's tasks dir for a one-off read.
 *
 * DECLARED UNIVERSE (same discipline as kobo-597's `knownSenderOracles`, and
 * for the identical reason: state what the detector CAN see, so a miss reads as
 * "outside the universe" instead of "the detector is broken"):
 *
 *   - STRUCTURAL: two open cards that share a `parentIds` entry or the same
 *     `epic` are flagged. Cheap, exact, no threshold, deterministic — catches
 *     two cells landing the same finding under the same parent (kobo-524/
 *     kobo-564, both filed under kobo-525) even when their title wording has
 *     nothing in common at all.
 *   - LEXICAL: title+body character-trigram Jaccard similarity — works the
 *     same on Thai (no whitespace word boundaries) and English/code-identifier
 *     text without a tokenizer. Catches a same-topic pair phrased with
 *     genuinely overlapping vocabulary (kobo-548/kobo-569, kobo-588/kobo-589).
 *
 *   OUTSIDE the universe, by measurement, not by omission — TWO declared classes:
 *
 *   (1) CROSS-LANGUAGE: the detector compares trigrams of the same title+body
 *   window it always sees (see class (2) below) — a pair that's the SAME
 *   underlying issue described with one card leaning heavily Thai and the
 *   other leaning heavily English/technical-identifier will share only
 *   common/functional words in that window, regardless of content overlap
 *   (kobo-582/kobo-399: one framed in Thai around cross-cell verdict
 *   delivery, one in English around cross-company ping leak — a real
 *   bug-for-bug duplicate this detector does not catch; the overlapping
 *   English tokens in kobo-582's own window are purely functional words —
 *   "card", "pane", "that", "tony" — not topic words). This is a SEMANTIC
 *   match, not a lexical one; no n-gram/token-overlap heuristic reaches it
 *   without an embedding model, deliberately out of scope (a
 *   card-creation-time check needs to stay cheap and synchronous). NOT a
 *   thai-only-vs-english-only LABEL (a coarse label misses most of the real
 *   class — a card that's overwhelmingly Thai and one that's overwhelmingly
 *   English are BOTH "mixed" under any two/three-bucket label, yet still miss
 *   each other): the real measure is each card's Thai-character RATIO within
 *   the detector's own window (title+body[:500]) — a pair sitting at opposite
 *   ends of that ratio is structurally invisible to this detector, regardless
 *   of how the exact distribution looks on any given day. Run the script for
 *   the current distribution and the current known-miss validation.
 *
 *   (2) OUTSIDE THE 500-CHARACTER WINDOW: `cardText()` below caps body at
 *   500 chars. Measured (not assumed) to be a real, board-wide blind spot,
 *   not a rare edge: most real cards carry a body well past this cap, so the
 *   detector's own working text is a truncated PREFIX for nearly every real
 *   card, and a large share of the corpus's total body content sits past
 *   that prefix, unread by either signal. Concrete real miss: kobo-562's
 *   distinguishing content — the identifiers `parse-args`, `permissive`,
 *   `positional` — sits entirely past the cap; a conductor nearly filed a
 *   duplicate of it and this detector would not have fired. Made worse by
 *   what IS inside the window: this codebase's own story-template opener
 *   ("As a ..., I want ..., so that ...") shows up inside the visible prefix
 *   on a large share of cards — so the visible window is disproportionately
 *   boilerplate every card shares, while the words that actually distinguish
 *   one card from another often live past it. Not fixed here (raising the cap
 *   is a real behavior change, not a doc fix — the 500-char choice itself was
 *   never re-examined against this data) — declared so a future miss reads as
 *   "known, bounded, tracked" rather than "silently broken". Run the script
 *   for the current coverage numbers.
 *
 *   Both classes are declared, honest residuals, not bugs to chase by
 *   loosening anything — see the threshold discipline note below for why
 *   "loosen it" is exactly the failure mode this card exists to close.
 *
 * THRESHOLD DESIGN — SELF-RELATIVE, NOT A BAKED-IN CONSTANT (round 2 of this
 * card's own design, reversing round 1): the first version fixed a single
 * numeric threshold from a frozen snapshot's negative-control distribution.
 * eq3's review caught the flaw in that approach directly: the candidate's
 * similarity SCORE against any one open card depends on how many OTHER open
 * cards exist (both the standard and, with the round-1 IDF weighting, the
 * score itself, move together as the corpus grows/shrinks) — so a threshold
 * frozen at one point in time is corpus-state baked into a constant, the EXACT
 * same anti-pattern kobo-597 ruled out for its fleet oracle-registry cache
 * (state that goes stale and nobody re-reads), just encoded as a number
 * instead of a file. The fix: at every card-creation event, compare the
 * candidate against however many open cards exist AT THAT MOMENT — a
 * comparison this function already has to do — then judge whether the TOP
 * score is an outlier RELATIVE TO THAT SAME BATCH'S OWN distribution (robust
 * z-score: `median + K * MAD`, median-absolute-deviation being the
 * outlier-resistant analogue of standard deviation), not against a number
 * chosen once and never revisited. This adapts automatically as the open-card
 * count changes; there is no state to go stale.
 *
 * `OUTLIER_K` and `OUTLIER_FLOOR` below are still fixed constants, but of a
 * different, disclosed kind: they scale a PER-EVENT statistic, not a raw
 * similarity score, so they don't encode "how similar is similar" for any
 * particular corpus size the way round 1's fixed threshold did. `OUTLIER_K`
 * is the standard "modified z-score" outlier convention from the statistics
 * literature (Iglewicz & Hoaglin) — chosen from that literature, not tuned to
 * this card's own labeled examples (an earlier pass DID pick a value that
 * way, by scanning for where a 2nd labeled pair started passing; caught in
 * review and reverted — see `OUTLIER_K`'s own doc comment for the full
 * story). Recall against the labeled set is deliberately not quoted here: the
 * labeled set itself is a small, fixed number of pairs, coarse enough that
 * a recall fraction reads as more precise than it is — run the script,
 * read the result as "consistent with working", not as a capability number.
 *
 * WARN-RATE — WHEN YOU RUN THE SCRIPT, STATE THE DENOMINATOR, NOT JUST THE
 * PERCENT (review round 1 finding, reviewer caught an earlier version of
 * this comment reading two different questions as if they were one): the
 * question that matches what a real user experiences is the SEQUENTIAL one —
 * walk every card in creation order as if it were the candidate at its own
 * real creation moment, comparing only against cards that already existed
 * and were still open at that instant (the script does exactly this,
 * matching what `addTask()` actually runs in production). A DIFFERENT,
 * LESS MEANINGFUL question — "of what's open right now, how much looks
 * similar to something else also open right now" — produces a different
 * number from the same corpus; the two are both real, only the first is what
 * a person creating a card actually sees. State which one you're quoting.
 *
 * SHARED-EPIC RUNS COLD ON REAL DATA MORE OFTEN THAN IT RUNS AT ALL —
 * measured, not assumed (review round 1 flagged this as suspicious and asked
 * it be checked instead of quietly left to read as if two structural signals
 * were equally active). Reason, also measured (run the script's shared-epic
 * section for current numbers): most same-epic candidate pairs fall inside
 * `BATCH_WINDOW_MS` (ordinary decompose siblings, created together) — and of
 * the ones that survive the window, on this board an epic's earlier children
 * overwhelmingly tend to reach a closed state before a later, unrelated
 * sibling gets added under the same epic. Net: shared-epic is not broken, it
 * is structurally near-unreachable given how this board's epics are actually
 * used day to day — kept because it's cheap/exact/zero-cost-when-idle and the
 * shape it exists for (kobo-524/kobo-564, filed under the same still-open
 * parent kobo-525) is real, just currently rare.
 *
 * CREATOR-BASED RESTRICTION — MEASURED AND REJECTED (review round 2 raised
 * "should shared-parent/shared-epic only warn when `by` differs, since a
 * late add to an existing epic is usually the SAME person who did the
 * original decompose?"): checked against the one confirmed real duplicate —
 * kobo-524 and kobo-564 were BOTH created by the same oracle. Every
 * shared-parent pair found in a real-corpus sweep was also a same-creator
 * pair. Restricting to different-creator-only would have missed the one real
 * case this card has ground truth for. Not implemented.
 *
 * BATCH-DECOMPOSE FALSE-POSITIVE CLASS (found during design, fixed before
 * shipping): a manual spot-check of an early, pre-batch-guard sweep found
 * sibling cards from the SAME epic decompose (kobo-417/kobo-420/kobo-416,
 * all children of kobo-414, created together within the same short burst) —
 * a legitimate task breakdown, not a mistake, flagged only because siblings
 * describing one feature naturally share vocabulary. The real duplicate in
 * the labeled set (kobo-524/kobo-564) was created a large, clean gap apart —
 * nowhere near decompose-batch timing. `BATCH_WINDOW_MS` excludes an existing
 * open card from EITHER signal if it was created within that window of "now"
 * (the candidate's own creation moment) — this is NOT a full fix for lexical
 * false positives in general (a longer tail of genuinely-unrelated-but-
 * worded-similarly pairs remains, e.g. kobo-122/kobo-411, no batch
 * relationship at all — a different, harder problem this card does not claim
 * to solve), but it measurably removes the ONE class an early spot-check
 * could name precisely and explain. A card added LATER to an epic that
 * already has several open children is a separate, NOT-yet-fixed noise shape
 * (review round 2): the window only protects same-batch siblings, not a
 * sibling added afterward — see the shared-epic note above for why this
 * hasn't shown up on real data yet, and the note-cap in store.ts's
 * addTask() for the defensive mitigation (a long note is capped, not
 * suppressed) if/when it does.
