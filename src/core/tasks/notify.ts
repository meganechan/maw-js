/**
 * Task comment notify (kobo-46) — "comment = poke แทน hey" (spec §Notify).
 *
 * When someone OTHER than the assignee adds a note to a card, the assignee gets
 * pinged so a comment doubles as a nudge. The ping goes out on the `task-events`
 * channel, so in a multi-pane warroom it lands in the target's COORDINATOR pane
 * (the oracle declared it via `maw route set task-events .N`, kobo-36) — never
 * straight into a worker pane. No mapping registered → `maw hey` keeps its
 * default-pane behavior; the routing decision is entirely the registry's, we only
 * tag the channel.
 *
 * Isolated + best-effort: we shell `maw hey` in a detached subprocess rather than
 * calling cmdSend in-process — cmdSend can `process.exit` on a delivery error,
 * which inside the maw server would take the whole server down. A spawn failure
 * is swallowed: the note is already durably stored + worklogged, delivery is a
 * nudge on top. `send` is injectable for tests (assert the argv without spawning).
