/**
 * Presence "away" read side (mawjs-3 / kobo-113; sticky kobo-287).
 *
 * An oracle/pane is "away" when its newest `away`/`back` marker is an `away`
 * (written by `maw presence away`, typically from /toilet). STICKY: ordinary
 * tool/prompt activity does NOT clear it — only an explicit `maw presence back`
 * (from /seat) does. Rationale (kobo-287): /toilet sets away at step-0 then does
 * its OWN rrr/forward tool-writes; under the old newest-wins-any-activity rule
 * those self-writes cleared away ~5s in, re-opening the overtype window mid-wrap
 * and at /clear — so "parks until /seat" was FALSE. Away is an explicit operator
 * toggle; it ends when the operator explicitly returns, not on background writes.
 * Tradeoff: a pane that forgot to /seat stays "away" until it does (seat-resume.sh
 * emits `back` on /seat, so the normal path self-heals). No new store.
 *
 * Used by the hey delivery gate (comm-send) to PARK a message to the receiver
 * inbox instead of injecting a pane whose operator has stepped out (and may be
 * mid-/clear — injecting would overtype). Delivery happens when they /seat.
 *
 * Company resolution is inlined as a light fs scan on purpose: importing
 * company-scope pulls company-helpers → the `maw-js/sdk` barrel, which a
 * cache-busting isolated re-import of the fragile comm-send delivery path can't
 * initialize cleanly. The company registry schema is stable, so a direct read
 * keeps the hot path barrel-free (mirrors companyOfOracle's membership lookup).
