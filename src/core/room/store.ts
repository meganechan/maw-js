/**
 * Brainstorm Room artifact store (kobo-241, slice 2).
 *
 * A "room" is an OFF-CARD note-thread artifact — a grounding conversation that lives
 * OUTSIDE any board and can be reopened. It uses a file-per-artifact PATTERN
 * (mawDataPath + atomic JSON write) under its own directory:
 * `~/.maw/companies/<c>/rooms/<id>.json` (front-confirmed store choice, kobo-241).
 * NO new store mechanism/DB/transport. The room→card distill link is gone with the
 * task subsystem — a room is now purely a conversation artifact.
 *
 * The thread persists here (durable, survives restart) so a reopen reloads the full
 * conversation. Turns are appended by the feed listener (src/core/room/listener.ts)
 * off the SAME [room:<id>] hey events the slice-1 wire already emits — no new capture.

 * Mint `count` sequential company-wide seq numbers in ONE read+write (kobo-415 blocker 2 —
 * backfilling a legacy room used to call this once PER message, each a separate sync disk
 * write; a 5000-message room measured ~700ms blocking the event loop on that one readRoom).
 * A persisted counter, not a scan — so backfilling one legacy room's messages never has to
 * re-derive the company max from every other room (which would recurse back through
 * readRoom's own backfill below).
 *
 * NOT cross-process safe: this is an unguarded read-increment-write, no lock. It is only
 * correct because every call today funnels through the single maw-server pm2 process (fork
 * mode, one instance) — appendRoomMessage is reached from route.ts/listener.ts only, never
 * from a CLI verb, and the MCP server talks to it over HTTP
 * (src/vendor/mpr-plugins/mcp/room-client.ts), not in-process. If a second writer to this
 * data dir is ever added — e.g. a CLI verb calling appendRoomMessage directly, or the server
 * running as more than one instance — this WILL mint duplicate seq. A real cross-process
 * guard (see src/lib/peers/lock.ts withPeersLock for the fd-based O_EXCL pattern already
 * used elsewhere) is a follow-up, not fixed here (kobo-415 reviewer verdict, 2026-07-27).
 *
 * FAIL LOUD on the two cases this CAN actually catch without that lock (kobo-415 lead
 * ruling — cannot resolve correctness → throw, never guess and continue, same principle as
 * kobo-431 item b):
 *   1. Unresolvable input — a corrupt/truncated counter file, or one missing its `seq`
 *      field. The old code silently treated both as "start over at 0", which re-mints every
 *      number already in use. Now it throws instead.
 *   2. A read-back mismatch right after this call's own write — if the counter doesn't read
 *      back as exactly what we just persisted, another writer's rename landed inside our own
 *      write window, or something rolled the file back underneath us.
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT AND CANNOT CATCH: two processes reading the SAME starting count before
 * either has written (the classic lost-update race). Each computes a range that looks
 * perfectly valid from where it stands, and each one's own read-back matches its own write —
 * there is nothing here for either process to notice. A per-room or per-company scan for
 * "is this number already used" would not close that gap either: the measured collisions
 * were CROSS-room, and a scan checking only the room being written would pass every time —
 * decorative, not a guard. Closing the real race needs the company-wide lock this design
 * deliberately avoided for cost (eq3 follow-up card).
