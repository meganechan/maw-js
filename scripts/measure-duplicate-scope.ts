/**
 * measure-duplicate-scope.ts — kobo-608's reproducible measurement script.
 *
 * duplicate-scope-warn.ts's own docstring intentionally carries NO frozen
 * numbers. Reason (kobo-608 card note has the full history): every number
 * this feature has ever quoted in prose — a docstring, a card comment —
 * independently failed re-verification once, 3 times in a row, by 3
 * different people, none of them careless: measured the wrong text window,
 * measured on a commit that had already moved, or simply couldn't be
 * reproduced at all. On a board that grows continuously, a number frozen in
 * a comment reads as permanent fact nobody re-checks — the SAME failure
 * class as a frozen name-list (kobo-597's `knownSenderOracles` residual is
 * a rule + dated examples for the identical reason). This script is the
 * single source of truth for "what does this detector actually do on a real
 * corpus right now" — RUN it, don't trust a number typed into prose.
 *
 * Reuses the real exported detector functions (`findSimilarOpenCards`,
 * `isWithinBatchWindow`, `BATCH_WINDOW_MS`) rather than reimplementing the
 * algorithm — a re-implementation could silently drift from what actually
 * ships; this can't.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/measure-duplicate-scope.ts --tasks-dir <dir-of-task-json-files>
 *
 * Point --tasks-dir at a directory of per-card task JSON files — a frozen
 * snapshot copy (recommended: measurements are only comparable across a
 * FROZEN corpus, never a live/growing one — see kobo-597/kobo-608's own
 * "freeze before comparing" lesson) or, for a one-off live read, a
 * company's live tasks dir (e.g. `~/.maw/companies/<company>/tasks`).
 * Read-only — this script never writes anything.
