 *   ~/.maw/companies/<company>/tasks/<id>.json
 *
 * SSoT split (glossary): task *state* lives here (one JSON per card); task
 * *events* go to the worklog append-log. The board reads the directory, so two
 * workers touching two different cards never race. Writes are atomic via
 * temp+rename (mirrors the consent-pending store) so a reader never sees a
 * half-written card.
 *
 * `claim` is a verb here, not an object: claiming sets `assignee` + moves state
 * to in-progress (ADR §1). wait-for is NOT stored — the board derives it.
 *
 * Mutators emit a worklog event so the activity feed stays the single timeline.

 *    declare its kind (dependency/needs_input/…); a kindless block is "blocked AND not
 *    really" — we refuse to persist it (throw) so a buggy caller surfaces loudly. The
