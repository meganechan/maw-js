 * 14). Returns a refusal string, or null to allow.

 * determined — unregistered oracle, or ambiguous (companyOfOracleStrict
 * throws or returns null) — this ALLOWS. That is the same conservative
 * default companyScopeViolation already uses for an unregistered COMPANY
 * (company-scope.ts:135-138), applied here to an unregistered/unresolvable
 * TARGET. It matters more here than there: Defect B's unknown-node fallback
 * specifically guesses a same-named LOCAL pane, which is exactly the kind of
 * target likely to have no company registration at all (a scratch/dev
 * session, not a real oracle) — so a guessed target with no determinable
 * company sails through this guard. Not fixed here; this function's job is
 * the mismatch case Tony approved (real company X sending to real company
 * Y), not inventing a stricter default for the unregistered case, which is a
 * separate, larger behavior change with its own regression surface across
