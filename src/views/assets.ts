 * kobo-398 — a dedicated, SAME-ORIGIN static-asset surface. There is NO existing
 * `/assets/*` route (grep-confirmed before writing this file) — this is a new
 * one, mounted the same way every other top-level view is (src/views/index.ts).
 *
 * Serves mermaid.js DIRECTLY from the pinned npm dependency at request time via
 * Bun.file — no build stage, no copied artifact that can drift from the pinned
 * version (package.json exact-pins `mermaid`, no caret). `?v=` is a client-
 * supplied cache-bust value; the server ignores it and always serves the
 * currently-installed pinned file — bumping the npm pin is the only way the
 * served bytes change.
 *
 * Same-origin (no CDN `script-src`), lazy-loaded by room.ts only when a
 * ```mermaid block is actually present (kobo-398 mechanism).
