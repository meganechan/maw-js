/**
 * Brainstorm Room artifact store (kobo-241, slice 2).
 *
 * A "room" is an OFF-CARD note-thread artifact — a grounding conversation that lives
 * OUTSIDE the kanban and can be reopened. It reuses the task store's proven
 * file-per-artifact PATTERN (mawDataPath + atomic JSON write), but a DIFFERENT
 * directory: `~/.maw/companies/<c>/rooms/<id>.json`. Because it's `rooms/` and not
 * `tasks/`, it is NEVER read by /api/tasks — it can't appear on a kanban lane
 * (front-confirmed store choice, kobo-241). NO new store mechanism/DB/transport.
 *
 * The thread persists here (durable, survives restart) so a reopen reloads the full
 * conversation. Turns are appended by the feed listener (src/core/room/listener.ts)
 * off the SAME [room:<id>] hey events the slice-1 wire already emits — no new capture.
